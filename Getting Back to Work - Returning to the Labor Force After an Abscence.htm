For the millions of Americans who decide to return to work after any type of
absence, there is good news: having an imperfect employment history may not be
the problem it once was. “People are more willing to show a resume that’s been
through stormy weather,” says Boston career counselor Ed Colozzi. Over the
years, he says, he has noticed a positive change in people’s determination to
stand up for themselves and their right to balance work with their personal
lives.<span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>“It was a scary time,” says Brian Trott of
his 9 months without a job. “I was unemployed with no benefits and no income
during the worst possible time in the job market.” The experience was a
humbling one. “You find yourself just sitting in the coffee shop, reading the
paper,” says Trott. “You get to that point where you get very down and
depressed.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>As Trott discovered, there are challenges to being out of
work. But if re-entering the workforce is your goal, make the most of your
downtime. The earlier that you invest extra effort in career planning, the
better off you’ll be later when you begin the job hunt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:14.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Sara Rix, senior policy advisor for AARP (formerly the
American Association of Retired Persons) in Washington, DC, says most successful
re-entrants do three things that contribute to their satisfaction: They
determine what they want to do, look to see if that type of work is available
in their communities, and do what they need to do to qualify for a job. </p>

<h2>Consider what you want to do </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt;text-indent:0in'>Jobseekers should think about their
interests and skills— and how to apply them in a work setting. Employment
counselors agree that assessing both what you like to do and what you are able
to do is critical to making a good job match. See the resources section at the
end of this article for information about self-assessment guides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>Employment counselors also suggest that jobseekers look at
how the world of work is constructed. Nearly all jobs involve working with some
combination of people, data, things, and ideas. Knowing what your preferences
are can help you decide which types of work environments are likely to be a
better fit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:14.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>Trott began exploring careers when he got discouraged in
his initial job search. With the help of a career coach, Trott started
identifying some employment choices. He referred to the <i>Occupational Outlook
Handbook</i> for detailed occupational descriptions, which include information
on working conditions and employment settings. Studying occupations in detail
helped Trott identify several that might be good for him, based on his
interests and skills.</p>

<h2>Know what’s out there</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt;text-indent:0in'>Once you know what you want to do, you
need to know whether you can find a job doing it. Examine your local job market
to see where opportunities exist. In the course of your research, you might
find a job you want to apply for. But generally, job-market exploration is your
chance to learn about possibilities rather than to search for a specific
position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>Conduct a search using common jobseeking methods,
including reviewing help-wanted listings, researching employers, “cold
calling,” and networking. By combining several activities, you can gain insight
into jobs in your community.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.4pt;margin-bottom:4.3pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>Informational interviewing is a way of combining research techniques.
Find employers that interest you, set up an appointment with as many as you
can, and then meet with workers who have jobs that you think you might enjoy.

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:105%'><span style='font-family:
"Franklin Gothic Book",sans-serif'>Jobseekers who have not maintained steady
employment should pause to think about why. It may be that the types of jobs a
person has held have not been well suited to him or her. This is one reason
that employment counselors stress the importance of jobseekers exploring what
they want to do as a step toward finding a job for the long term. </span></p>

margin-left:-.75pt;line-height:105%'><span style='font-family:"Franklin Gothic Book",sans-serif'>Jobseekers
need self-knowledge so that they can be advocates for themselves. Most
employers are reluctant to hire and train someone who will not stay in the

and providing assurance that the pattern is not likely to continue, improves
the chances of getting a job. </span></p>

style='font-family:"Franklin Gothic Book",sans-serif'>Additionally, jobseekers
can avoid having to reveal the full extent of an intermittent employment past.
Counselors note that there are a lot of different ways to write a resume, so
jobseekers need to create one that makes the most of their skills without
emphasizing their employment history—using a functional rather than a
chronological format, perhaps, or providing only years of employment instead of
including months and days. After all, a person does not have to account for
every minute of his or her time.</span><br clear=all style='page-break-before:

learn about a job’s educational requirements and whether the employer provides
training, how people typically get started in the occupation, and what’s
required to be promoted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.45pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Trott found informational interviewing valuable and
recommends it for other jobseekers. But, he cautions, remember that arranging
for these interviews usually involves cold calling—contacting workers or
employers who don’t know you—and that cold calling often is unsuccessful. “If I
got 2 out of 10 people to talk to me, I was doing really well,” says Trott.
“You’ve got to deal </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>with some rejection. It’s not easy, but you
have to keep at it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.45pt;margin-bottom:
14.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>In addition to helping you learn about occupations
and employers, informational interviews help you to network. And networking,
discussed in more detail later, is a crucial tool for scoping out the “hidden”
job market. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Meet job qualifications </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.7pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>The more you learn about what you want to
do and what your local job market offers, the more you should learn about the
qualifications needed for the types of positions you want. Consider testing
your interests in a “real world” work situation before launching into a
full-fledged pursuit of a new career. Volunteering, job shadowing, or similar
hands-on opportunities might help you to discover whether a job that seems just
right on paper is all wrong in reality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:13.6pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>If you determine that you need some training or
retraining, employment counselors suggest pausing to make sure that you’re
ready to invest the required effort and money. When you’re prepared to commit
to training, the next step is to find out how much to get and where to get it.
Employers are one source of training; some occupations involve
employer-provided training specific to a company or a job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Community colleges are another possible training source.
See the resources section at the end of the article for information about
community colleges and other training courses and programs, including where to
find them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.7pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Training varies, depending on the type and complexity of a
subject area. Some people might have to take only a class or two. Other people,
especially those who are retraining to enter a different occupation, might need
to enroll in a lengthy program. Ultimately, only you can decide what’s right
for you. When Julie Pearson realized how unhappy she was in her previous job,
she stepped off the work path and went to school full time for 2½ years. “I
won’t lie: it was hard,” she says. “But I haven’t looked back.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.95pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:22.85pt'>Pearson’s decision to go back to school was an informed
one. With the help of a career counselor, she considered what her skills were
and what she wanted from a job. Pearson researched careers and concluded that
the occupation of dental hygienist seemed a perfect fit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>The self-assessment made a difference; Pearson now
thoroughly enjoys what she does. “You spend a lot of time at work,” she says,
“but if you can find the right job, it’s almost like you’re not working.”</p>

margin-left:22.85pt;text-indent:0in'>For many jobseekers, especially
re-entrants, getting ready to join the working world can seem daunting. After
all, most workers want more than just a paycheck, says Troy Justesen, deputy
commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration in Washington, DC.
“It’s one of the first questions someone asks when you meet: ‘So what do you
do?’” he says. “Work defines our identity. It contributes to our self-worth and
sense of pride.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.0pt;margin-bottom:15.4pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>Minimize the stress of looking for work by knowing what to
expect. Help prepare yourself by finding out where to get career assistance,
being ready to work hard to find a job, and thinking about ways to balance work
with life. </p>

re-enter the workforce, he didn’t go it alone—he had help in the form of career
resources, assessments, and counseling. You, too, can benefit from many types

There are a variety of other options for employment assistance. Most colleges

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:14.6pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Employment offices, employment
counselors, and community organizations provide valuable assistance to
jobseekers. Still, it is important to recognize that these resources have
limitations—and the success of your job hunt depends, primarily, on your efforts.
“A lot of places offer help, but it’s up to you to take control of your job
search,” says Grant Collins, a former welfare coach and current chief of staff
for the Office of Family Assistance in Washington, DC. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.9pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Collins and other counselors stress that the most
successful jobseekers are those who are proactive. Trott, for example, didn’t
just sit in the coffee shop; he took action that led to results. “I’ve been at
my job 11 months now—and I love it!” he says. “I enjoy what I do, but I spent a
lot of time getting here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.55pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Dedicating a great deal of time and effort to a job
search is not only recommended, it’s essential. Most employment counselors
suggest that people look for work in an organized way, as if the search itself
were a full-time job. Begin each morning just as you would if you were going to
work: get up early, get dressed, and have breakfast. Then, approach the day’s
regimen of job-hunting tasks with the same interest and professionalism that an
employer would expect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.3pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Taking charge and approaching a career search
seriously can help you focus on the importance of finding a job. And as Trott

jobseeking efforts pay off.</p>

on getting a job quickly than on finding a long-term career. Any job done well
can help establish solid, postconviction employment performance and thereby
pave the way for better future opportunities. Jobseekers should also find out
if having a criminal record prevents them from entering or resuming work in any
occupations that interest them. Federal and State laws differ in barring
licensure of convicted felons in some occupations, such as security guard. </span></p>

style='font-family:"Franklin Gothic Book",sans-serif'>There are also some
things that ex-offender jobseekers can do to help themselves. If they do not
have these documents already, jobseekers should get a birth certificate, a
Social Security card, and photo identification as soon as possible because
proof of identification is required for employment. Some employment counselors
suggest that jobseeking ex-offenders get a copy of their criminal  arrest
record, or “rap sheet,” to review what is on it and to check it for mistakes.
In addition, jobseekers might want to consult their State’s repository of
criminal records or contact an attorney about the possibility of having a
criminal record sealed or expunged. </span></p>

applying for a job, ex-offenders should tell the truth about their criminal
record. Being truthful might cause difficulty in the short run, but the
alternative—lying to get a job, only to have an employer later discover a
conviction—can cause more difficulty in the long run. Honesty does not,
however, mean that jobseekers need to put specifics about a conviction on an
application. Instead, counselors recommend writing something like, “I welcome
the opportunity to explain the circumstances surrounding my conviction during
an interview.”   </span></p>

margin-left:-.75pt;line-height:105%'><span style='font-family:"Franklin Gothic Book",sans-serif'>It
is best not to go into too much detail during a job interview when talking

such as completion of coursework or proof of skills relevant to the job.</span></p>

are also benefits available to employers—such as tax credits and Federal

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Balancing work with life</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:13.4pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Life isn’t just about work. If you
haven’t had a job for a while, though, it might be harder to draw a line
between your work and your life. This is because the absence of a job has
allowed you to do other things and fulfill other commitments. Managing your
life has become your job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.55pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>In preparing to re-enter the workforce, it is
important to recognize that balancing life and work involves making tradeoffs.
“It’s a matter of figuring out what part you want a job to play in your life,”
says Chris Olson, a counselor at the New Ulm, Minnesota, Life-Work Planning
Center, which assists homemakers in their return to work. This is important
whether you’re starting over or just sorting things out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.0pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><b><i>Starting over</i></b>. For some people, getting back
to work is part of beginning anew. Larry Matthews wanted to make a fresh start
of his life when he was released from prison after serving a 7-year sentence.
“The hardest part is when you first come out,” says Matthews. “No one accepts
you. You need to get back into society.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.0pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>One of the first things Matthews did toward that effort was
to get a job. He credits his success to his decision to stay strong, keep
focused, and not look back. “I kept to my plan to get a job and stay out of
trouble,” he says. And his determination has helped him to excel at work, get
his own place, and be a good role model for his son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.55pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'><b><i>Sorting it all out</i></b>. Knowing how work
fits into your life also helps you to define yourself. “It’s important to
develop a work identity,” says Suzanne Wagner, research associate of Project
Match, a Chicago-based organization that has developed the Pathways Case
Management System for State and local welfare agencies. “Everyone develops
various identities, based on the relationships they have and the roles they
play. Often, nonwork identities, such as that of a parent, spouse, or
significant other, are stronger and take priority. So when there are problems,
the work part of a person’s life is the first to go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.15pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Wagner illustrates by citing Sarah, a Pathways
participant in New York who was ready to return to work despite being a single
mom with many demands on her time. When Sarah first went back to work, says
Wagner, she was overwhelmed to the point of being nearly unable to function.
But with the help of her Pathways counselors, Sarah was able to create a
specific, step-by-step plan each month to address her problems and focus on
getting a better job. </p>

efforts. After she sorted out many of her personal problems, Sarah pursued a
longstanding interest by enrolling in an auto mechanics course and getting a

goals into mini-goals, helping Sarah to see her life as manageable and her
goals as achievable.  </p>

Jobseekers and employment counselors say it’s important to remember that
success will come, but it might take time. Try not to get discouraged as
applications or resumes are rejected or go unanswered, as they sometimes will
be. Don’t worry about whether your prior employment record, or lack of one, is
a hindrance. Instead, throughout the jobseeking process, picture yourself doing
work you enjoy. As Theresa Green says, “Really, it’s your </p>

who do not have much practical experience may feel that they lack options. The
same is often true for jobseekers who have more experience than a position

new skills.    </span></p>

People who have a limited employment history can still have a significant work
history. Jobseekers should think about the skills they use in what they do and
where they go in their everyday lives. Some of those skills might qualify as
experience that can be applied in a job. Unpaid work, such as volunteering or
performing community service, often allows people to gain experience. </span></p>

margin-left:-.75pt;line-height:105%'><span style='font-family:"Franklin Gothic Book",sans-serif'>Employment
counselors say that jobseekers who have little or no employment history should
look for an entry-level position—especially one that provides an opportunity

The opposite problem of having too little experience is having too much. In an
interview, an employer might say something offputting, such as, “You’re
overqualified” or “We can’t pay you what you’re accustomed to.” When responding
to comments of this nature, jobseekers might want to let the interviewer know
that they are aware of what the job involves or what its general level of pay
is, that they want the job, and that they are a good fit for it—and why.  </span></p>

margin-left:-.75pt;line-height:105%'><span style='font-family:"Franklin Gothic Book",sans-serif'>Jobseekers
who have significant experience may encounter some degree of age bias. One way
in which more experienced jobseekers can respond is to redirect the prospective
employer’s attention by discussing how their skills can benefit the employer’s
organization. Counselors suggest saying something like, “I have experience, but
I also have enthusiasm and up-to-date skills, and I learn new tasks quickly.”  </span></p>

workers may want to keep some dates off their resume. For example, by the time

work experience, experienced jobseekers can demonstrate their motivation and

promise high earnings in a short time, require a purchase, or charge fees, for

because employers frequently use their Web sites or online job banks to post

margin-left:31.85pt'><b><i>Resumes for re-entry</i></b>. A resume provides much
of the same information as an application, but it allows greater flexibility.
This flexibility extends to the ease with which resumes are created on personal
computers. Gone are the days when jobseekers could send out multiple copies of
the same resume; most employers now expect resumes to be tailored to each
advertised vacancy. The one-type-fits-all resume is no longer very effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.95pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:31.85pt'>Employment counselors point out that there are many
different resume styles, although some may be more appropriate than others for
re-entry situations. The most common styles are functional and chronological.
How you decide to structure your resume, counselors say, depends on which style
is best for emphasizing your strengths and downplaying your weaknesses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;

A functional resume—one that focuses on skills rather than work history—is
usually preferred if you’ve been out of the workforce for a while. When
creating a functional resume, focus on tasks or skills you’re good at, such as
budgeting or management, and then build your resume around them. Tailor these
skill sets to the job you’re applying for; in other words, find out what types
of skills the employer is looking for, and then find concrete examples of when
or how you have demonstrated the skills. A brief summary of work history
usually follows this skills presentation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>When Julie Pearson applied for a job in her new field, she
focused on the skills she gained in her previous job. “It became a really big
selling feature,” she says. “You always have some sort of transferable skill,
and my old job gave me good communication and computer skills. It showed that I
was professional and knew how an office works, and employers were interested in
what I could do for their business environment.” Pearson’s resume helped
convince herself as well as her employer. “Making the switch wasn’t as hard as
I thought,” she says. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The functional resume is not for everyone, however. If you
have a relatively solid record of employment, you might want to highlight it by
using the chronological resume, a more traditional format in which a listing of
jobs held is presented from most recent to least. Even if you choose this
format, you may still want to include a short skills summary at the top of your
resume to focus on your greatest selling points. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;

can be easily overcome. Brian Trott says that he got around having to mention

neat and accurate. A sloppy, error-filled letter isn’t likely to convince an
employer that you would do a good job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.25pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:22.85pt'>Employment counselors say that the cover letter might
also be a good place for re-entrants to explain any noteworthy gaps in job
history that employers might otherwise view with suspicion. But counselors
stress that jobseekers should keep this explanation short and not mention any
unnecessary negatives. Keep the focus on your abilities and the reasons why
you’d be an ideal person to hire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.4pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'><b><i>Work references for the jobless</i></b>. At some
point in the job search, you will likely be asked for the names and contact
information of several people who can vouch for your character and work ethic.
It’s a good idea to think about these references before you’re asked for them.
As a courtesy, you should also inform people before you use them as references
and explain that potential employers might be contacting them to discuss
you.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>If possible, employment counselors say, try and reconnect
with people you used to work with. Green says that she has asked former
employers to be references for her, and all—even the one who fired her—were
willing to help. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>If you haven’t had a job recently, there are other options.
Green isn’t currently employed, opting instead to volunteer for a nonprofit
organization. And although she says she would be able to get a recommendation
from her last employer, she doesn’t plan on using old references when she is
ready to go back to work. “I am active in my volunteer work for the nonprofit,
on the PTA and PTO boards, and at church,” she says. “So now I’d probably use
recommendations from these activities.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>Employment counselors agree with this approach.
“Volunteering shows that you are able to get somewhere on time and be there on
a regular basis,” says Suzanne Wagner of Project Match, “and this is what
employers are looking for.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:14.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>To identify possible references, think about people you’ve
come in contact with who might be able to convey to employers that you are
dependable and hardworking. For example, recent graduates might want to ask a
former instructor, coach, or mentor to serve as a reference. </p>

Most employers want to meet applicants before deciding whether to hire them.
Making a good impression when you’re face to face with an employer is the next
step in getting back to work. Preparing for this meeting is one of the best
ways to ensure success. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:14.2pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'><b><i>Prepare and rehearse</i></b>. It is important,
employment counselors say, to do your homework and know something about the job
before going into the interview. Employers want to know how well your skills
and abilities match those required for the position they’re looking to fill.
So, the more you know about what they want, the easier it will be to
demonstrate that you’re a good fit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.2pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Finding out about the job should include finding out
about the company, suggests Francina Carter, correctional program specialist
for the National Institute of Corrections in Washington, DC. “If you have time,
do some research,” she says. “Find out what the company does or what it makes.”
Researching the company enables you to better explain to employers why you want
to do the job, she adds. Many public libraries have reference materials
available, and most companies provide general information about themselves on
their Web sites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.1pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Brian Trott agrees that research is important. When he
finally got a job, he says, it was largely due to the work he put in upfront.
“I went in to my interview with a file full of research on the company, and
they were, like, ‘Wow!’” he says. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.5pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Employment counselors also say that practicing for an
interview really helps. This practice includes thinking about how you will
answer some of the questions you are likely to be asked. It also includes doing
mock interviews or rehearsing your answers aloud. In addition, consider the
interview itself as practice: you may not get the first (or second or third or
more) job you interview for, but each interview gives you an opportunity to get
better at presenting yourself to employers. Evaluate your performance after
each unsuccessful interview—contact the employer, if you can—to find ways to
improve for the next time.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.25pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Interview questions fall into three general
categories, say counselors: Employers want to know if you can do the job, if
you will do the job, and if you will fit in. In the interview, you need to
affirmatively and proactively communicate your answers to these questions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Re-entrants should also realize that some techniques may
have changed since they last interviewed for a job. “An interview is no longer

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>who you are, how your skills fit, and how
you will handle yourself.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Russell explains by describing the behavioral interview, a
common technique in which interviewers propose a hypothetical situation and ask
how an applicant would react. The scenario might be intended to reveal your
approach to having multiple deadlines to meet or the role you would take when
working in a group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Overall, you want the employer to come away from the
interview with a clear understanding of why you would be a valuable employee.
To convey this, discuss what you’re offering and why you’re the best person for
the position. In other words, show self-confidence. “I had to believe in
myself,” says Trott.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><b><i>Time off, not wasted time</i></b>. When preparing for
an interview, you should also think about what to say about your time spent not
working. Addressing employment gaps yourself, instead of letting the
interviewer raise them, gives you a chance to head off any misconceptions an
employer might have about your work history. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Employment counselors suggest that you not lead with an
explanation of your time off, but rather embed it within discussions about your
experiences or accomplishments. Mentioning experiences that are directly
relevant to the job for which you are interviewing helps you take control of
the situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Trott says that during interviews, his period of
unemployment did come up. “I explained to them, ‘I’ve done a lot of work to get
here today,’” he says. His effort— exploring careers; determining his skills,
interests, and values; and researching the company and the positions he
interviewed for—gave him the confidence that he was right for the job. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>It’s perfectly OK to stand up for yourself and your
decisions when talking about why you stopped working, say counselors. And, they
add, if not all of your choices were wise ones, it’s often a good idea to
acknowledge this. Then move on to talking about improvements you’ve made and
things you’ve accomplished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>“If you’re talking to employers and explaining a gap in
your resume, it may be for raising a family, or traveling to Europe for a
year,” says Troy Justesen of the Rehabilitation Services Administration. “If
there are other reasons, be clear, but stress, ‘It will have no bearing on my
ability from this point forward.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><b><i>Difficult or illegal questions</i></b>. Personal
questions that don’t have anything to do with your ability to do a job, such as
questions about your age, marital status, or disability, are often illegal.
However, employment counselors say that employers sometimes don’t know the law.
So, if you’re asked illegal personal questions during interviews, you should
probably assume that the employers don’t have bad intentions. “If they did, you
wouldn’t want to work for them anyway,” says Linda Batiste, a consultant at the
Job Accommodation Network in Morgantown, West Virginia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.45pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:22.85pt'>Employment counselors say that it’s usually best not
to respond “That’s illegal!” when asked an inappropriate question; such a reply
would reduce your chances of getting the job. Batiste says that some people
find a way of addressing the question, while others brush over it and use the
opportunity to provide supplemental information. “Each individual should
respond in the way he or she is most comfortable with,” she says. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>But no matter how you choose to handle difficult
questions, try to respond in a way that redirects the conversation toward your
skills and abilities as they relate to the job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'><b><i>Interview day</i></b>. On the big day, remember to
gravitate toward the positive. If you’ve made it to the interview, it means the
employer likes what you have to offer. Your preparation has given you an added
advantage. Stay positive, keep focused, and try to relax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>It’s normal to feel stressed when you’re in a job
interview, say employment counselors. Even if you’re anxious, try not to
display this outwardly with nervous habits, such as tapping your feet. You
should also dress professionally, shake hands, smile, and look the interviewer
in the eyes when communicating. Arriving early or on time is also important, so
you may want to practice getting to the site before the day of the interview if
you aren’t sure where you’re going or how long it will take you to get there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:22.85pt'>When it came time for Trott’s interview, he was ready.
“You sell them,” he said. “You’ve got to show them that you’re sincerely
interested.” But don’t overdo it. Although you want to impress the interviewer,
counselors say, you should not try to present yourself beyond where you are in
either your training or your career. </p>

Follow up the interview with a thank-you letter, which provides another
opportunity to highlight why you would be a good choice for the position.
Continue the job hunt while waiting to hear back, and you’re well on your way
toward re-employment. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Putting it all together</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Getting back to work may take awhile, even
if you do everything right. But try not to get discouraged. “Know that there is
something out there for you,” says career counselor Ed Colozzi. “Success may
not come on the first try, but it will come.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Counselors say that sometimes, if people are having
trouble, they may need to re-evaluate their expectations and desires. Instead
of seeking to enter a new career at the same level you were in your previous
field, for example, you might consider seeking an entry-level position to gain
experience. “It may not be your dream job,” says </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Francina Carter of the National Institute
of Corrections, “but it can lead to a better one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.6pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Take Larry Matthews, for example. When he was first
released from prison, Matthews took a job in food services. After 2 weeks, he
was promoted to a warehouse position; after another month, he became a
supervisor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>“Now, I run the place,” says Matthews.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>One-Stop Career Centers have employment counselors who may
be able to help you examine what you’ve been doing and suggest modifications to
your plan. Private employment counselors can help in this way, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Supportive discussion groups can also be helpful. “If
people have been out of work a long time,” says Chris Olson of the Life-Work
Planning Center, “it’s important for them to find out that what they’re going
through is normal, that they’re not alone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Matthews agrees. “You can’t let your self-esteem get low,”
he says. “Get together with others who are going through the same thing, and
start talking about it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><b><i>Words of experience</i></b>. Brian Trott offers
encouragement for jobseekers who might feel discouraged, as he once did. “Keep
going, because it will come together,” he says. “It’s a generic thing to say,
but it’s true.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Larry Matthews offers similar advice. “Be strong and keep
your head up,” he says. “Have faith.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Your options are more numerous than you might think, adds
Julie Pearson: “You’d be surprised at what you can swing. I never would’ve
thought I could do it.”    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.4pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Your journey to re-entry will give you personal insight and
job-search knowledge that will remain a valuable tool as you manage your future
career and the changes it may bring. “Now that I’m not working again, it will
be me deciding what I want to do when I’m ready to get a job,” says Theresa
Green. “And I look forward to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>that challenge.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:31.85pt;text-indent:0in'>When getting ready to re-enter the
workforce, you might feel overwhelmed thinking about all the resources you need
to find. Your employment or career counselor and local library should be at the
top of your list of people and places to visit. Counseling offices and
libraries  provide career resources and, often, access to equipment—such as
computers, printers, and the Internet— that are helpful to jobseekers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:31.85pt'>Along with general references, such as telephone books and
business reports, many public libraries have a career-reference section that
includes books, magazines, locations of employment offices, and other resource
materials on a wide range of topics. Employment or counseling offices may also
have contact information to help you start networking with local employers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:31.85pt'>On either visit, look for publications from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), including the <i>Occupational Outlook

Outlook Quarterly</i>. The <i>Handbook</i> (also available online at <b>www.bls.gov/oco</b>),
